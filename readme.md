This is an app created for the intentions to provide a user with a clean and easy to use platform where they can plan their projects and collaborate with others.

## Motivation:
Our motivation for creating this app is based on our desire to help people plan effeciently. We were inspired by trello to create an app that allowed for users to organize their thoughts but also collaborate with other users.
