## Welcome to ViewTube
## A personal and collaborative video library


This is an app created out of a wild dream that I have of creating an alternative platform for users to post their video creations. The goal that this website is trying to achieve is to be a platform where users have the freedom to add any youtube video that they would want to add to their collection.
